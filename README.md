# About Me

## My Interests
I am passionate about fitness and enjoy going to the gym regularly to stay active and healthy. My workout routine often includes strength training, cardio, and calisthenics. The discipline and focus I gain from working out helps me in other areas of life as well.

In addition to fitness, Iâ€™m an avid gamer. I enjoy both casual and competitive gaming, with a particular interest in role playing games (RPGs) and strategy games. Gaming allows me to unwind, connect with friends, and immerse myself in engaging storylines and challenges.

I also have a strong interest in coding, particularly in Python, where I work on data science and automation projects. I enjoy building tools to solve problems and exploring how algorithms can be applied to various fields, especially finance.

Lastly, I am deeply involved in algorithmic investing. I use data analysis and machine learning techniques to develop strategies for trading cryptocurrencies and other financial instruments. This helps me to stay ahead of market trends and make informed investment decisions.
