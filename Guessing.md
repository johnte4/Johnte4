## Explanation of the Flowchart

1. **Start**: The game begins.
2. **Generate Random Number**: The computer randomly selects a number within a predefined range.
3. **Prompt User for Guess**: The user is prompted to input a guess.
4. **Check If Input is Valid**: The program checks if the input is a valid number.
   - If invalid, an error message is shown, and the user is prompted again.
5. **Compare Guess to Random Number**: The valid guess is compared to the random number.
   - If the guess is too high, the user is informed and prompted to guess again.
   - If the guess is too low, the user is informed and prompted to guess again.
   - If the guess is correct, the user is informed, and the game ends.
